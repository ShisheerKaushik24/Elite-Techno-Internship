# Elite-Techno-Internship
I am glad to have been given chance to participate in Skill India Internship Program on Python for ML/Al Internship at Elite Techno Groups.

Within One month, I had a chance to learn a lot about Data Science. It was a very effecctive learning experience. Throughout the Course I have done some Industry Oriented project like as Inventory Management and Summer Olympics. It has enhanced my skills and knowledge in this perticular field.

I am Thankful to my mentor Ashish Jangra sir for having me in this program and for quantifuying the complex topics to interesting and simpler.

I would also like to thank Mr. Mayank Arora &  Elite Techno Team
who gave this excellent opportunity.
